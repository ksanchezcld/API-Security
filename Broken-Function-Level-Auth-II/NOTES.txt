Securing an API is a critical task. A bad API design may lead to system compromise. Its impact becomes more critical when a crucial service gets affected like a Banking API.

The Banking WebApp allows a user to update their password and Email ID after a successful login. The issue is that authorization system in place is not properly implemeted. The Banking API just validates the token and allows the user to reset the password of the account corresponding to the provided Email ID. Therefore, anyone having a valid token could update the password for any other user if the Email ID of the other user is known.

Note: The authorization system relies on a scope parameter in the issued token. If the token issued to a user has the scope of "account-write", then they get write access on the account, else, for token having the scope of "account-read", the user gets read-only access to the account.

Objective: Leverage the vulnerability to hijack admin's account and retrieve the Golden Ticket from the Bank API!

Instructions: 

This lab is dedicated to you! No other users are on this network :)
Once you start the lab, you will have access to a Kali GUI instance.
Your Kali instance has an interface with IP address 192.X.Y.2. Run "ifconfig" to know the values of X and Y.
The Banking WebApp is running on port 5000 on the target machine having IP address 192.X.Y.3.
Do not attack the gateway located at IP address 192.X.Y.1
